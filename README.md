RVCC IDMX 225 Web Page Development course
My name is Jackie. I graduated with a degree in math & computer science from Carnegie Mellon and worked as a software developer at Bell Labs/ATT for many years.  Although I've been retired for quite some time (and my computer skils are out-of-date), I enjoy learning new technologies.  About 10 years ago I decided to teach myself how to build websites when a tennis club I belonged to needed a better solution to their tennis court reservation system.  That project inspired me to develop several personal websites (e.g. herold-schultz-scholarship.com for a scholarship fund I established and Metuchen62.com to document my high school class's 50th  reunion).  I'm looking forward to broading my website knowledge through this course and am amazed at all the website development tools that are available today.
